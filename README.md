# Kieran Blackstone – Why am I here?
I am one of the founders and Directors of Tecknuovo, a DevOps & Cloud recruitment business. Currently doing as much as I can to learn about the technologies we recruit. Slowly getting my head around basic coding and half way through my AWS Solution Architect course. On a mission to change the perception of recruiters... one commit at a time. I founded Tecknuovo because I truly believe that the face of recruitment must change. Cold calling, surface level information and spamming databases isn’t a dying trade... it's dead.

Starting this project to see if a publicly accessable platform with relevant information about actual opportunities is a better way of engaging with the engineers. Hopefully I learn a lot along the way.... if there are any specific questions/ information that you think I should include in each branch (Opportunity) please let me know and ill add it in.
